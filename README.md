# Call-of-Duty-Stars

## COD Stars is an application that allows Call of Duty: Warzone players to track their player stats using their battletag.

This application takes the input of a user's battletag and uses it to pull information from Call of Duty: Warzone. Once a user has signed up and logged in, or logged in with an existing account, The application can track up to four players. After every match a player can go in and view their current stats including: Kills, Downs, Deaths, and Revives. Each of those adds or detracts a point from a player score. The entire data starts over every 12 hours.
